## GraphQL Caching System

The project implements a three-tier caching strategy using Redis to optimize GraphQL query performance for immutable game state data.

### Caching Architecture

#### Tier 1: Response-Level Caching
- **Implementation**: Custom Apollo Server plugin (`src/graphql/responseCache.ts`)
- **Class**: `RedisCache` implementing Apollo's `KeyValueCache` interface
- **Key Prefix**: `graphql:` for all cache entries
- **Key Format**: `graphql:{query-hash}:{variables-hash}` (auto-generated by Apollo)
- **Null Prevention**: Responses containing null values are NOT cached to prevent caching errors

#### Tier 2: Field-Level Caching
- **Implementation**: Manual caching in resolvers (`src/graphql/generated/Gamestate.ts`)
- **Cached Fields**:
  - `Gamestate.budget` - Key: `budget:gamestateId:{id}`
  - `Gamestate.planets` - Key: `planets:gamestateId:{id}`
- **Strategy**: Check cache first, on miss load via DataLoader and cache result
- **TTL**: No expiration (immutable data)

#### Tier 3: DataLoader Batching with Request-Scoped Cache
- **Location**: `src/graphql/dataloaders/`
- **DataLoaders**:
  - `budgetLoader`: Batches budget queries by gamestateId
  - `planetsLoader`: Batches planet queries by gamestateId
  - `gamestatesLoader`: Batches gamestate queries by saveId
- **Purpose**: Prevent N+1 query problems and provide request-level deduplication
- **Lifecycle**: Created per GraphQL request (request-scoped)
- **Database Functions**: Calls batch query functions like `getBudgetBatch()`, `getPlanetsBatch()`

### Redis Configuration

- **Client**: `ioredis` library (v5.8.2) configured in `src/redis.ts`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `STELLARIS_STATS_REDIS_HOST` (default: 'redis')
  - `STELLARIS_STATS_REDIS_PORT` (default: 6379)
  - `STELLARIS_STATS_REDIS_DB` (default: 0)
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff (50ms * attempts, max 2000ms, 3 max retries)
- **Deployment**: Redis 7.4-alpine container with persistent volume storage, internal network only (no exposed ports)

### Cache Control Directives

- **GraphQL Schema**: Uses `@cacheControl` directive in `graphql/schema.graphql`
- **Cached Types**: `Budget` and `Gamestate` types marked with `@cacheControl` (no maxAge specified)
- **Default Behavior**: No caching unless explicit `@cacheControl` directive present
- **TTL Strategy**: No expiration for immutable types (game state data never changes once stored)

### Cache Invalidation

- **Current Implementation**: None
- **Rationale**: Game state data is immutable - once parsed and stored, it never changes
- **Considerations**: Redis memory may grow over time; consider implementing eviction policy (e.g., `allkeys-lru`) if needed

### Query Flow

```
GraphQL Query
  → Apollo Response Cache (check)
    → Resolver Field-Level Cache (check)
      → DataLoader Request Cache (check)
        → Batch Database Query
          → Store in all cache layers
            → Return result
```

```

## Development Guidelines

Use these guidelines and rules whenever you're making changes to the codebase.

### General Principles

#### GraphQL Schema and Grafana Dashboard Synchronization

When modifying the GraphQL schema at `graphql/schema.graphql`, check if Grafana dashboards need corresponding updates:

- Grafana dashboards are located in the `grafana/` directory
- Dashboard JSON files contain hardcoded column definitions and GraphQL queries that mirror the schema structure
- If you add, remove, or rename fields in the GraphQL schema's `BudgetCategory` or `BudgetEntry` types, the affected dashboards must be updated to maintain consistency
- Each dashboard panel typically has:
  - Column definitions (`columns` array) specifying which fields to display
  - GraphQL query (`body_graphql_query`) that fetches the data
- Both the column definitions and GraphQL queries must be kept in sync with the schema
- After schema changes, review all dashboard files to identify which ones query the modified types

- When editing code or other files, don't add comments.
- When creating or updating code, do only edits that the user has asked you to do.
- Ignore all errors that existed before you started editing code.
- Do not add any extraneous features that the user hasn't asked you to do. Instead, you are allowed to ask the user if you should add such features.
- Do not perform any extraneous fixes to the code that are unrelated to the task that you're completing.
- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

### Git & Commits

#### When to Commit

- Only create commits when explicitly requested by the user.
- If unclear whether to commit, ask the user first.

#### Before Committing

Before creating a commit, always:

1. Run `git status` to see all untracked and modified files
2. Run `git diff` to review unstaged changes
3. Run `git diff --cached` to review staged changes (if any)
4. Run `git log --oneline -5` to check recent commit message style

#### Commit Message Style

- Prefer concise, one-liner commit messages when possible
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- For multi-line messages:
  - First line is the summary
  - Blank line
  - Additional context as bullet points if needed
- **Do not add any "authored by", "co-authored-by", or attribution lines**
- **Do not add emoji or "generated with" signatures**

#### Commit Safety

- Never run destructive/irreversible git commands (force push, hard reset) unless explicitly requested
- Never skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign) unless explicitly requested
- Never amend commits from other developers - always check authorship first with `git log -1 --format='%an %ae'`
- Never force push to main/master branches
- Pre-commit hooks (husky, lint-staged) will run automatically - this is expected behavior

#### Example Commit Workflow

```bash
# Review changes
git status
git diff

# Stage relevant files
git add file1.ts file2.ts

# Create commit with clean message
git commit -m "Add budget migration TypeScript conversion"

# Verify commit
git status
```

### Quality Checks

After making changes to the codebase, verify your code by running the appropriate commands from the Development Commands section:

- Always use `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` tool to verify that code passes linting and formatting checks.
- For TypeScript changes: Run `npm run build` to verify no compile errors with up-to-date generated GraphQL files.
- For Python changes: Run type checking, linting, and formatting commands as listed in the Python Commands section.

### TypeScript Guidelines

- In addition to the guidelines in this chapter, you must always apply quality checks from the previous chapter (linting, formatting and building).

#### Code Style

- Use strict typing and strict null checks.
- Never use type casting ("as" keyword).
- Never use non-null assertions ("!" keyword).
- Always check that the code you edit do not have any type errors.
- When having the option of using async and sync version of a library, prefer async version.
- Always use arrow function syntax instead of function keywords.
- Prefer ternary operators over if/else statements.
- Always use generated Zod schemas and TypeScript types from GraphQL code generation when working with GraphQL data structures.

#### Dependencies

- TypeScript dependencies are managed in `/workspace/package.json`.
- Always use exact versioning and latest possible versions.

### Python Guidelines

#### Code Style

- Use strict typing with full type annotations for all functions, variables, and class attributes.
- When having the option of using async and sync version of a library, prefer async version.
- Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions over map/filter when readability is maintained.
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management.
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions: snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes.

#### Environment & Configuration

- Python virtual environment managed with uv.
- Dependencies defined in `/workspace/agent/pyproject.toml`.
- Use `uv sync` command to update `/workspace/agent/uv.lock`.
- Ruff is configured for linting and formatting (configuration file location: `/workspace/agent/pyproject.toml`).
- Pyright is configured with strict type-checked rules (configuration file location: `/workspace/agent/pyproject.toml`).
- Always check that the code you edit does not have any type errors.

#### Dependencies

- When adding dependencies to pyproject.toml, always use exact version, without caret (^) or other version specifiers.
- Always use latest versions of dependencies where possible.
